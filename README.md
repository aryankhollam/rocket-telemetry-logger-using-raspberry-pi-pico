# Rocket Telemetry Logger Using Raspberry Pi Pico

![Project Image](avionica+_bb.jpg)

This project is a rocket telemetry logger that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to log roll, pitch, and altitude data from an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope and a BMP280 barometric pressure sensor. The data is displayed on an SSD1306 OLED screen and logged to an SD card for further analysis.

---

Features
- Logs roll, pitch, and altitude data to an SD card.
- Displays real-time data on an OLED screen.
- Plays a tone sequence on startup and shutdown using a buzzer.
- Uses the IBF method to calculate altitude from barometric pressure.

Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- MPU6050 (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)
- BMP280 (Barometric Pressure Sensor)
- SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64)
- MicroSD Card Module
- Buzzer
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- MicroSD Card (formatted to FAT32)

---

Software Requirements
- MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico
- Libraries:
  - `machine` (built-in)
  - `imu` (for MPU6050)
  - `bmp280` (for BMP280)
  - `sdcard` (for SD card)
  - `ssd1306` (for OLED display)
  - `math`, `time`, `os` (built-in)

Installation
1. Flash your Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython. Follow the official guide [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install micropython-mpu6050
   pip install micropython-bmp280
   pip install micropython-ssd1306
   ```
3. Upload the `main.py` script to your Raspberry Pi Pico.
4. Connect the hardware as per the wiring diagram (see below).

Usage
1. Power on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
2. The buzzer will play a startup tone sequence.
3. The OLED display will show real-time roll, pitch, and altitude data.
4. Data will be logged to the SD card in the file `/sd/sensor_log.txt`.
5. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the program. The buzzer will play a shutdown tone sequence.

## Warnings
1. Double-Check Wiring: Incorrect wiring can damage your components. Always double-check connections before powering on the circuit.
2. Power Supply: Ensure the Raspberry Pi Pico and all components are powered correctly. Overvoltage can damage the Pico and sensors.
3. SD Card Formatting: The SD card must be formatted to FAT32. Incorrect formatting can cause data logging to fail.
4. BMP280 Calibration: The BMP280 sensor may require calibration for accurate altitude readings. Refer to the datasheet for calibration procedures.
5. MPU6050 Orientation: Ensure the MPU6050 is mounted correctly in your rocket. Incorrect orientation will result in inaccurate roll and pitch calculations.
6. Buzzer Volume: The buzzer can be loud. Use a resistor in series if necessary to reduce the volume.
7. Data Logging: Ensure the SD card has sufficient space for logging. Data loss may occur if the card runs out of space.
